## [ButterBot](butterbot)

ButterBot is a remote controlled robot, designed to mimic a character from the TV show _Rick and Morty_. Butterbot moves around on tank treads, can say catchphrases from the tv show, and is able to be controlled from a mobile phone. (Or at least that's the plan anyways...)
